A Top Down Game, created for me to study, created entirely in the Godot Engine, with the goal of learning and completely mastering the Engine.

Feel free to use it however you want


## How to Run the Game

First, install Godot on your machine (if you don't have it). Then, download the zip file from this repository, extract the file and save it to your desktop.
Open Godot and click on ''export'', select the folder, and that's it!!!
the game will start
